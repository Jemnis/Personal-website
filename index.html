				Hey ! My name is Jenish, and I'm a formidable opponent. I'm a second-year student at Softwarica College, and I'm utterly obsessed with creating, coding, and coming up with ideas that might actually make a difference.
				I'm the one that holds the team together when it comes to collaboration. I do well in group situations, and I'm always ready to provide a helping hand. But don't misunderstand my openness to working with others for a lack of strength; I'm a determined problem-solver who isn't hesitant to take the initiative when necessary.
				Because I really think that perseverance and dedication are the secrets to success, I uphold these principles in everything I do. I constantly challenge myself to do better, learn more, and take on new challenges.
				I'm ready to take on the world – are you?
